# Dupont holder

This is just a thing I needed, because I insist on connecting the two sides of my split keyboards with dupont connectors, which is a great and terrible idea at the same time. Without something to hold them in place, they tend to get loose and suddenly half my keys don't work. 
So this little box does the job, and it also has a innie/outie marker so I don't mess up while setting up things.
